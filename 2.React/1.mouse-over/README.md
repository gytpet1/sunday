 - What are the problems with this component?
 - What would you refactor?
 - What is your opinion about this style of coding?

 1. I think it's everything ok, with this component. Code is clean and easy to read.
 2. I would split components into 2 parts. Cards component and App component, to keep code clean. Also we can make constant for className property.
 3. Code is clean enough, everything is good with style.
